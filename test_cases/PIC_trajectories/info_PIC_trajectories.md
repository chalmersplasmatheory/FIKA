This is an example of electron trajectories obtained from a particle-in-cell simulation with the SMILEI code. The file for the FIKA input `PIC_particle_set.h5` was obtained with the Smilei converter (see `README.md`). The radiation has synchrotron-like character, corresponding to betatron radiation from laser wakefield acceleration. Electron beam is moving in the positive $x$ direction undergoing small transverse betatron oscillations in the $y$ & $z$ directions. The `final_spectrum.h5` file contains the spectrum summation of the whole electron beam. The `individual_spectra.h5` file containing the individual spectra of particles is not shared here git but was produced during the calculation.

The macroparticle spectra (`PIC_macroparticle_weights = False` option in `input.py`) output can be found in the `without_macroparticle_weights/` folder.  The `final_spectrum.h5` file contains the spectrum summation of the whole electron beam. The `individual_spectra.h5` file containing the individual spectra of particles is not shared on git, but was produced during the calculation.

Real-particle spectrum (`PIC_macroparticle_weights = True` option in `input.py`) can be found in the `with_macroparticle_weights/final_spectrum.h5`.
Both cases can be plotted with `plot_spectrum_PIC_trajectories.py` for comparison.

The options in the input file were as follows: The position of the observer was chosen 1 m distance from the beam on the x-axis (in the positive direction). It corresponds to r = 1, phi = 0, theta = pi/2. E_slice_eV = 10 and t_slice_s = 1e-16 were chosen in the spectral summation.

This is an example of electron trajectories obtained from a particle-in-cell simulation with the SMILEI code [1]. The file for the FIKA input `test_particle_set.h5` was obtained with the Smilei converter (see `README.md`). The radiation has synchrotron-like character, corresponding to betatron radiation from laser wakefield acceleration. The electrons are moving in the positive $x$ direction undergoing small transverse betatron oscillations in the $y$ & $z$ directions.

The macroparticle spectrum (`PIC_macroparticle_weights = False` option in `input.py`) can be found in `no_weights_serial/` and `no_weights_parallel/` folders, calculated by the serial and parallel version of the code (with 4 CPUS), respectively.  The `final_spectrum.h5` file contains the spectrum summation of all the tracked macroelectrons. The `individual_spectra.h5` file containing the individual spectra of particles is not shared here on git, but was produced during the calculation.

Real-particle spectrum (`PIC_macroparticle_weights = True` option in `input.py`) can be found in the `weights_serial/` and `weights_parallel/`, calculated by the serial and parallel version of the code (with 4 CPUS), respectively. Both cases can be plotted with `plot_spectrum_PIC_trajectories.py` for comparison. Four separate radiation pulses can be observed in the temporal profile, coming from four separate electron beams from different wakefield periods.

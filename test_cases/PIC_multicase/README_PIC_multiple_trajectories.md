The multicase test case is tailored for comparing multiple spectrums produced by FIKA. It is used by adding separate case folders to the `PIC_multicase` folder and wherein the respective `final_spectrum.h5` files are to be put. When this is done, the script `plot_multicase.py` can be modified and ran to produce temporal and spectral profiles of every use case. Along with the figures, `multiplot_data.csv` is produced and contains information (critical energy, peak intensity and FWHM pulse time) about all the cases.

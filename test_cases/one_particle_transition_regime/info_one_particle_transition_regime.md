Script `get_trajectory_one_particle_transition regime.py` generates a HDF file with the trajectory of one electron with total (kinetic + rest) energy of $E_{e}=25$ MeV moving in the $x$ direction in plasma with plasma frequency $\omega_p$, where plasma density is $n_e=5\times 10^{18}$ $\rm{cm}^{-3}$. It oscilates in the $y$ direction with a simple sinusoidal motion with amplitude $r_\beta=0.5$ $\rm{\upmu m}$ and betatron frequency $\omega_\beta = \omega_p/\sqrt{2\gamma}$, where $\gamma$ is the electron Lorentz factor. The motion is in the transition regime between undulator and wiggler, i.e., undulator parameter $K = 1$. The on-axis fundamental frequency can be calculated as

$$
\omega_1 = \frac{2 \gamma^2 \omega_\beta}{1+K^2/2} \approx 26\hspace{0.5cm}\rm, 
$$

where the undulator parameter corresponds to

$$
K = 1.33 \times 10^{-10} \sqrt{\gamma n_e\rm{cm}^{-3}} r_{\beta}\rm{\upmu m}.
$$

The on-axis spectrum is expected to have peaks in the fundamental frequency $\omega_1\approx 26$ eV and several odd harmonics. After FIKA calculation, final data can be plotted with `plot_spectrum_one_particle_transition_regime.py`. This example can be compared with the results in Horn√Ω, V., et al. $\it{Physics of Plasmas}$ 24.6 (2017).
